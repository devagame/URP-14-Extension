FSR 2.2 for Unity
This project aims to bring FSR2 to Unity, as an alternative to Unity's existing FXAA, SMAA and 
TAA anti-aliasing solutions. Compared to Unity's TAA implementation, FSR2 offers a sharper and more stable image,
with a better sub-pixel detail resolve and better performance due to its reliance on upscaling.
